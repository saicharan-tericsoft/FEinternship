    <p>
        The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
        Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
        Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
        Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
    </p>
    <p id="global"></p>
    <p id="block"></p>
    <p>Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

        Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:</p>
    <script>
        let x = 10;

        {
        let x = 2;
        document.getElementById("block").innerHTML="Block "+x;
        // Here x is 2
        }
        document.getElementById("global").innerHTML="GLobal"+x;
        // Here x is 10
    </script>
</body>
