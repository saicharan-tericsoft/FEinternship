    <p>The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
        Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
        Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
        Variables defined with const have Block Scope.</p>
    <p>
        It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

        Because of this you can NOT:

        Reassign a constant value
        Reassign a constant array
        Reassign a constant object
        But you CAN:

        Change the elements of constant array
        Change the properties of constant object
    </p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <p>
        If you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter JavaScript Hoisting.

        Variables defined with const are also hoisted to the top, but not initialized.

        Meaning: Using a const variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:

    <p>Adding a number and a string, returns a string.</p>

    <p id="string"></p>

    <script>
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        cars[0] = "Toyota";
        let x = 5 + 5;
        let y = "5" + 5;
        let z = "Hello" + 5;
        document.getElementById("string").innerHTML =
            x + "<br>" + y + "<br>" + z;
        cars.push("Audi");
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=cars;
