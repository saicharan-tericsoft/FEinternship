    <h2>When used in an object method, this refers to the object.</h2>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <h2>When used alone, this refers to the global object.

        Because this is running in the global scope.
        
        In a browser window the global object is [object Window]:</h2>
    <h2> In strict mode, when used alone, this also refers to the global object:
        In a function, the global object is the default binding for this.

    In a browser window the global object is [object Window]:
    JavaScript strict mode does not allow default binding.

    So, when used in a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
    </h2>
    <h2>In HTML event handlers, this refers to the HTML element that received the event:</h2>


    <p id="demo1"></p>
